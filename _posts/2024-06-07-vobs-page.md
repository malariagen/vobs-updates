We've created a [new landing page for the Vector
Observatory](https://www.malariagen.net/vobs/) on the MalariaGEN
website. The web page showcases the different components of the
observatory, including data, training, tools, compute resources,
partners and research. It also provides an entry point into the
relevant documentation websites for each component. Hopefully this
will be a useful focal point for engagement with the community and
users of the observatory.
