The [lectures and notebooks from the first
workshop](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/workshop-1/about.html)
of our training course in data analysis for genomic surveillance of
African malaria vectors have been published on the course website.

This training workshop introduces the use of genomic data to analyse
mutations in the gene targeted by pyrethroid insecticides. The
workshop comprises four modules:

* Module 1 - Interactive cloud computing with Google Colaboratory

* Module 2 - Accessing and exploring Anopheles genomic data

* Module 3 - Navigating the Anopheles gambiae reference genome

* Module 4 - Analysing SNPs in the Vgsc gene
