Nagi et al. (2024) [AnoPrimer: Primer Design in malaria vectors
informed by range-wide genomic
variation](https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.20998.1) was
published in Wellcome Open Research.

The paper describes AnoPrimer which is a Python package which exploits
data from the vector observatory to allow rapid primer design in
*An. gambiae* and *An. funestus*, whilst summarising genetic variation
in the primer binding sites and visualising the position of primer
pairs.
