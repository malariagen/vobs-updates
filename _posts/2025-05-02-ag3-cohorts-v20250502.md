A new cohorts analysis version `20250502` has been released for the
Ag3 data resource. This is now the default cohorts analysis version
when using the `malariagen_data` [Ag3
API](https://malariagen.github.io/malariagen-data-python/latest/Ag3.html). This
cohorts analysis will be available for datasets up to and including Ag3.15.

Please note that the new cohorts analysis may change the values of
sample metadata columns including `taxon`, `admin1_iso`,
`admin1_name`, `admin2_name`, and derived columns beginning `cohorts_`
relative to previous cohorts analysis versions.

To pin this cohorts analysis when accessing data:

{% highlight python %}
import malariagen_data

ag3 = malariagen_data.Ag3(
    cohorts_analysis="20250502",
)
{% endhighlight %}

This new version introduces some key changes: 

- Samples previously labeled as `gcx3` in the `taxon` field have been renamed to `pwani`:
    - `gcx` (`gambiae complex cryptic taxa`) labels serve as placeholders for groups outside our usual taxonomic assignment 
    - Following [Mwinyi et al. (2024)](https://github.com/malariagen/vobs-updates/blob/master/_posts/2024-11-06-mwinyi-tanzania-paper.md), the `gcx1` group has been renamed to `Pwani molecular form`
    - 65 samples previously assigned as `gcx3`, are now labeled as `pwani`.
        - 54 samples from `AG1000G-KE`
        - 11 samples from `AG1000G-TZ`
    - Cohort names have been updated, e.g. `KE-14_gcx3_2012` is now `KE-14_pwan_2012`

- 3 previously `bissau` samples have been reclassified as `unassigned`.
    - 1 sample from `1188-VO-NIANG-NIEL-SN-2304-VMF00259`
    - 2 samples from `1323-VO-GM-NGWA-VMF00242`
