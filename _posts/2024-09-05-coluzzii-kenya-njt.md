Alistair Miles posted [Anopheles coluzzii in Kenya - neighbour-joining
tree
analysis](https://alimanfoo.github.io/2024/09/05/kenya-coluzzii-njt.html)
on his blog. The article replicates the neighbour-joining tree
analysis from the recent paper by Kamau et al. (2024) on Anopheles
coluzzii in northwestern Kenya, and demonstrates the new `plot_njt()`
function in the `malariagen_data` Python API.
