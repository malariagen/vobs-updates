The [lectures and notebooks from the seventh
workshop](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/workshop-7/about.html)
of our training course in data analysis for genomic surveillance of
African malaria vectors have been published on the course website.

This training workshop focuses on the use of genomic data to investigate the spread of insecticide resistance between mosquito populations.
The workshop comprises four modules:

* Module 1 - Organophosphate resistance markers (combining SNP and CNV data)
* Module 2 - Adaptive gene flow
* Module 3 - Investigating gene flow at loci of interest using haplotype clustering
* Module 4 - Investigating gene flow at loci of interest using haplotype networks
