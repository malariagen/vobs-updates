To mark World Mosquito Day, the MalariaGEN comms team posted an article [Levelling up malaria vector control](https://www.malariagen.net/article/levelling-up-malaria-vector-control/) on the MalariaGEN website. 
The article includes comments from three vector observatory partners about the role that genomic data resources and capacity building can play in malaria vector control across Africa.
