A new cohorts analysis version `20240924` has been released for the
Ag3 data resource. This is now the default cohorts analysis version
when using the `malariagen_data` [Ag3
API](https://malariagen.github.io/malariagen-data-python/latest/Ag3.html). This
cohorts analysis is available for datasets up to and including Ag3.11.

Please note that the new cohorts analysis may change the values of
sample metadata columns including `taxon`, `admin1_iso`,
`admin1_name`, `admin2_name`, and derived columns beginning `cohorts_`
relative to previous cohorts analysis versions.

To pin this cohorts analysis when accessing data:

{% highlight python %}
import malariagen_data

ag3 = malariagen_data.Ag3(
    cohorts_analysis="20240924",
)
{% endhighlight %}

This new version introduces some key changes: 

- Samples previously labeled as `gcx1` in the `taxon` field have been renamed to `bissau`:
    - `gcx` (`gambiae complex cryptic taxa`) labels serve as placeholders for groups outside our usual taxonomic assignment 
    - Following [Caputo et al. (2024)](https://malariagen.github.io/vobs-updates/2024/09/10/caputo.html), the `gcx1` group has been renamed to `Bissau molecular form`
    - 291 samples previously assigned as `gcx1`, are now labeled as `bissau`.
    - 5 previously `unassigned` samples are also relabeled as `bissau`.
    - Cohort names have been updated, e.g. `GM-M_gcx1_2019` is now `GM-M_biss_2019`

- 36 `unassigned` samples have been reclassified as: 32 `melas`, 2`gambiae`, 1 `fontenillei`, 1 `arabiensis`.

- A location metadata error affecting the administrative region (level 1) of 119 samples has been corrected:
    -  `admin1_iso` updated from  `UG-E` to `KE-04` 
    -  `admin1_name` updated from  `Eastern Region` to `Busia`
    - Cohort names have been updated, e.g. `UG-E_arab_2013` has now been relabeled to `KE-04_arab_2013`
