A new cohorts analysis version `20240515` has been released for the
Af1 data resource. This is now the default cohorts analysis version
when using the `malariagen_data` [Af1
API](https://malariagen.github.io/malariagen-data-python/latest/Af1.html). This
cohorts analysis is available for datasets up to and including Af1.4.

Please note that the new cohorts analysis may change the values of
sample metadata columns including `taxon`, `admin1_iso`,
`admin1_name`, `admin2_name`, and derived columns beginning `cohorts_`
relative to previous cohorts analysis versions.

To pin this cohorts analysis when accessing data:

{% highlight python %}
import malariagen_data

af1 = malariagen_data.Af1(
    cohorts_analysis="20240515",
)
{% endhighlight %}
