The [lectures and notebooks from the third
workshop](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/workshop-3/about.html)
of our training course in data analysis for genomic surveillance of
African malaria vectors have been published on the course website.

This training workshop covers the use of genomic data to analyse
population structure in mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae
complex. The workshop comprises four modules:

* Module 1 - Plotting with Plotly Express
* Module 2 - The biology of population structure
* Module 3 - Genome-wide SNP data
* Module 4 - Detecting population structure using PCA
