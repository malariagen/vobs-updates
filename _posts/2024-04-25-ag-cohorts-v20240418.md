A new cohorts analysis version `20240418` has been released for the
Ag3 data resource. This is now the default cohorts analysis version
when using the `malariagen_data` [Ag3
API](https://malariagen.github.io/malariagen-data-python/latest/Ag3.html). This
cohorts analysis is available for datasets up to and including Ag3.10.

To pin this cohorts analysis when accessing data:

{% highlight python %}
import malariagen_data

ag3 = malariagen_data.Ag3(
    cohorts_analysis="20240418",
)
{% endhighlight %}
