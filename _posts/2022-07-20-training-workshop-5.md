The [lectures and notebooks from the fifth
workshop](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/workshop-5/about.html)
of our training course in data analysis for genomic surveillance of
African malaria vectors have been published on the course website.

This training workshop covers the use of genomic data to quantify,
characterise and compare genetic diversity in mosquito
populations. The workshop comprises four modules:

* Module 1 - Xarray datasets
* Module 2 - Introduction to genetic diversity
* Module 3 - Genetic diversity summary statistics
* Module 4 - Heterozygosity and runs of homozygosity
