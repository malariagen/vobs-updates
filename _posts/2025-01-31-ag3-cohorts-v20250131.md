A new cohorts analysis version `20250131` has been released for the
Ag3 data resource. This is now the default cohorts analysis version
when using the `malariagen_data` [Ag3
API](https://malariagen.github.io/malariagen-data-python/latest/Ag3.html). This
cohorts analysis will be available for datasets up to and including Ag3.14.

Please note that the new cohorts analysis may change the values of
sample metadata columns including `taxon`, `admin1_iso`,
`admin1_name`, `admin2_name`, and derived columns beginning `cohorts_`
relative to previous cohorts analysis versions.

To pin this cohorts analysis when accessing data:

{% highlight python %}
import malariagen_data

ag3 = malariagen_data.Ag3(
    cohorts_analysis="20250131",
)
{% endhighlight %}

This new version introduces some key changes: 



- 1 sample previously identified as 'gambiae' has been labelled as 'unassigned' in sample set 1191-VO-MULTI-OLOUGHLIN-VMF00140.

- 1 sample previously identified as 'unassigned' has been labelled as 'bissau' in sample set 1188-VO-NIANG-NIEL-SN-2304-VMF00259.

- Administrative and cohorts sample metadata have been added for the following sample sets: 1324-VO-ET-GOLASSA-VMF00275, 1339-VO-GH-AMENGA-ETEGO-VMF00302.
