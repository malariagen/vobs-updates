The [lectures and notebooks from the second
workshop](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/workshop-2/about.html)
of our training course in data analysis for genomic surveillance of
African malaria vectors have been published on the course website.

This training workshop introduces the use of genomic data to analyse
mutations in genes that cause metabolic resistance to
insecticides. The workshop comprises four modules:

* Module 1 - Introduction to pandas DataFrames
* Module 2 - The genetic basis of metabolic resistance to insecticides in Anopheles mosquitoes
* Module 3 - Detecting CNVs from genome sequence data
* Module 4 - Analysing CNV frequencies at metabolic resistance genes
