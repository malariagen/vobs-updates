The [lectures and notebooks from the fourth
workshop](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/workshop-4/about.html)
of our training course in data analysis for genomic surveillance of
African malaria vectors have been published on the course website.

This training workshop covers the use of genomic data to investigate cryptic mosquito species within the Anopheles gambiae complex. The workshop comprises four modules:

* Module 1 - NumPy arrays
* Module 2 - Species complexes and cryptic taxa in malaria vectors
* Module 3 - Ancestry-informative markers (AIMs)
* Module 4 - Discovering cryptic taxa
