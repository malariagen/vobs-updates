The [lectures and notebooks from the sixth
workshop](https://anopheles-genomic-surveillance.github.io/workshop-6/about.html)
of our training course in data analysis for genomic surveillance of
African malaria vectors have been published on the course website.

This training workshop focuses on the use of genomic data to discover genes under recent positive selection.
The workshop comprises four modules:

* Module 1 - Haplotypes
* Module 2 - The biology of selective sweeps
* Module 3 - Detecting new forms of insecticide resistance using selection scans
* Module 4 - AnoPrimer - Primer Design in Anopheles gambiae
