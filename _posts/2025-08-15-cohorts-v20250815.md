A new cohorts analysis version `20250815` has been released for the
Ag3 data resource. This is now the default cohorts analysis version
when using the `malariagen_data` [Ag3
API](https://malariagen.github.io/malariagen-data-python/latest/Ag3.html). This
cohorts analysis will be available for datasets up to and including Ag3.16.

Please note that the new cohorts analysis may change the values of
sample metadata columns including `taxon`, `admin1_iso`,
`admin1_name`, `admin2_name`, and derived columns beginning `cohorts_`
relative to previous cohorts analysis versions.

To pin this cohorts analysis when accessing data:

{% highlight python %}
import malariagen_data

ag3 = malariagen_data.Ag3(
    cohorts_analysis="20250815",
)
{% endhighlight %}

This new version does not introduce any key changes. 

 If you need to access the previous version of the cohorts analysis, you can pin it using the code in [here](https://malariagen.github.io/vobs-updates/2024/10/02/ag3-cohorts-v20250502.html).
